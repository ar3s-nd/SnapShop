## Scope for future improvements
1. Addition of two types of users- customers and sellers. Customers are able to view and buy the products while the sellers are able to add new product directly through the app. Sellers would have to verify themselves before they can identify as a seller.
2. Search function for customers to search for products.
3. Recommend new products to customers using machine learning models based on their search history and previously bought products.
5. Automatically find customer's location without the customer having to set their location using plugins like [geolocator](https://pub.dev/packages/geolocator) and [geocoding](https://pub.dev/packages/geocoding).
6. Greater flexibility for users in updating their profile details.
7. Add payment interface.
8. Better UI using tools like figma.
